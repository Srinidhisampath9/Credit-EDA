# Credit-EDA
### Project Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and inform subsequent modeling steps.
## Project Files
### Data
app_data.csv: This file contains the credit dataset. It includes various features related to credit information.
Notebooks
Credit_EDA.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the exploratory data analysis. It includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and initial insights.
### Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Analysis Workflow
The analysis is divided into the following sections:

1. Data Loading: Importing the credit dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
3. Data Visualization: Plotting distributions, correlations, and other relevant visualizations to understand data characteristics.
4. Feature Analysis: Exploring the relationships between different features and the target variable.
5. Conclusion: Summarizing the findings and insights from the EDA.
## Results
The results of the analysis are presented through various visualizations and statistical summaries. Key insights include distributions of features, correlations, and potential predictors for credit-related outcomes.
